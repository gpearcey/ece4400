2. the function works normally for ints and doubles
when the result is a whole number. It is incorrect if the type 
is int and the result is not a whole number because the result 
is rounded. It also does not work for strings. 

3. average({1,2,3,4}) gives 2, because it processes the values
as ints, and it rounds 2.5 down to 2. When std::vector<double> values = {1,2,3,4};
is used instead, the result is 2.5. 

5. Would be same as in 2.

1. The array can't hold objects like std::string because it's not a basic data type. 
std::string is an object and "bigger.get()[i] = (*this)[i];" will only work for basic 
data types, because it is making copies and doesn't handle construction and destruction
of the values being copied, which is required for strings. Once the string array size 
is larger than 8, there will be an error. 

4. The GrowableArray average() method works with ints, doubles, and strings.
It works with strings because it uses the template add() method, and the operator 
overload functions. You can instantiate GrowableArray<string> regardless of whether average() 
is called. The when GrowableArray<int> is instantiated, the average() method returns a 
rounded result.
